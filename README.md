# Lead Management Task Submission

This repository contains my submission for the Full Stack Developer role assessment.

-   **Scope:** Full Stack (Frontend + Backend)
-   **Time Taken:** Approximately 3 hours

---

## âœ… Core Features Implemented

I focused on building the primary CRUD (Create, Read) functionality as outlined in the task.

-   **Backend:**
    -   A **Node.js/Express.js** server to handle API requests.
    -   **MongoDB** integration using Mongoose for data persistence.
    -   API route for creating a new lead (`POST /api/leads`).
    -   API route for fetching all leads (`GET /api/leads`).
    -   Basic schema validation for the `leadSchema` model.

-   **Frontend:**
    -   A **React** application for the user interface.
    -   A lead capture form with fields for Name, Email, Phone, etc.
    -   The form submits new lead data to the backend API.
    -   A list/table component that fetches and displays all existing leads from the API on page load.
    -   Styling is done using **Tailwind CSS**.
